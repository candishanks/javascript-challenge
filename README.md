# javascript-challenge

In the excersize, I used the provided index.html file and app.js files to create create the website. 
Using Javascript, I was able to create a table using the provided data and connect it to the index.html file. 
From there, I used live share to monitor the changes I was making. 

The table was created using the standard table creation method in Javascript.
Two main functions were created, one to create the initial table and one to create a filtered table. 

The website successfully lauches and performs as required.
